# Switch to Backend

- Express server
- Simple HTML, CSS and JS Client
- Prisma & MongoDB

There are some changes from the original code. The Hello World route is now replaced with a health check. Additionally there is some boilerplate for posts route. I also added cors, you can google it up.

I have setup basic Prisma with MongoDB. And added a GET route to retrieve data from DB and one POST route to add data to the DB. Look up for updating data, deleting data. Additionally you can learn how to retrieve only selective data or pagination in Prisma.
